# Proj0500: Only include packages with an explicitly defined license
Using a [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org) (third-party) package implies that you
and/or your company explicitly agree with the legally binding conditions of the
license and the copyright of the owner of the package.

As Microsoft states it itself:
> If a package does not specify the licensing terms, contact the package owner
> directly using the Contact owners link on the [NuGet.org](https://www.nuget.org)
> package page. Microsoft does not license any intellectual property to you
> from third party package providers and is not responsible for information
> provided by third parties.

When you use packages that are only (privately) shared within your company
those packages are advised to explicitly define a license. You
might need to contact your legal department to define a proper license.

This rule can detect missing licenses in NuGet spec files, but can not be
considered legal advice, nor is this documentation.
