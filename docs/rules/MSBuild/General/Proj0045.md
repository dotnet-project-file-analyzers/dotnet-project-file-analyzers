# Proj0045: Convention-based MSBuild file names should use correct casing
Some MSBuild files have a certain role during the build based on a naming
convention. Although MSBuild is mostly case-insensitive, this having different
casing might cause issues, especially on files systems (Unix for instance) that
are case-sensitve. This rule will report when the casing of such convention
based files is off.

## Compliant
Files for which the casing is checked:
* .editorconfig
* .globalconfig
* .net.csproj
* CompatibilitySuppressions.xml
* Directory.Build.props
* Directory.Build.targets
* Directory.Packages.props
* global.json
* NuGet.config
* packages.lock.json
