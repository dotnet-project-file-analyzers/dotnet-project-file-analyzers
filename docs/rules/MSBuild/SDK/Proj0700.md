# Proj0700: Avoid defining <Compile> items in SDK project
The [.net.csproj SDK project](/docs/sdk.html) is a placeholder for
non-compiling files. Adding `<Compile>` items has no meaning, as the
project has no (publically) accessible compilation artifacts.

## Non-compliant
``` xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <ItemGroup>
    <Compile Include="Code.cs" />
  </ItemGroup>
  
</Project>
```

## Compliant
``` xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <ItemGroup>
    <None Include="Code.cs" />
    <Content Include="Code.cs" />
	<AdditionalFiles Include="Code.cs" />
  </ItemGroup>
  
</Project>
```
