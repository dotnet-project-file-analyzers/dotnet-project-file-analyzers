# Proj0016: Order project references alphabetically
`<ProjectReference>` nodes should be ordered alphabetically
within a single `<ItemGroup>` in order to make it more
human readable. When ordering the references based on
other criteria, consider grouping them in separate
`<ItemGroup>`s.

The rule assumes data sorted based on the `@Include` attribute applying
`StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase`.

## Non-compliant
``` xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <ItemGroup>
    <ProjectReference Include="LibraryB" />
    <ProjectReference Include="LibraryA" />
  </ItemGroup>
  
</Project>
```

## Compliant
``` xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <ItemGroup>
    <ProjectReference Include="LibraryA" />
    <ProjectReference Include="LibraryB" />
  </ItemGroup>
  
</Project>
```
