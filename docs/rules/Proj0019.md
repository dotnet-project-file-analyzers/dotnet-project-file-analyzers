# Proj0019: Order using directives alphabetically
`<Using>` nodes should be ordered alphabetically within a single `<ItemGroup>`
in order to make it more human readable. When ordering the references based on
other criteria, consider grouping them in separate `<ItemGroup>`s.

The rule assumes data sorted based on the `@Include` attribute applying
`StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase`.

## Non-compliant
``` xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <ItemGroup>
    <Using Include="NamespaceB" />
    <Using Include="NamespaceA" />
  </ItemGroup>
  
</Project>
```

## Compliant
``` xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <ItemGroup>
    <Using Include="NamespaceA" />
    <Using Include="NamespaceB" />
  </ItemGroup>
  
</Project>
```
