# Proj0031: Adopt preferred casing of nodes
MS Build is (mostly) case insensitive. For project files, that means that the
root node (`<Project>`) and its child nodes (such as `<PropertyGroup>` and
`<ItemGroup>`) are case sensitive, but their ancestors are not. To prevent
issues, however, it is preferred to use the same casing consistently.

## Non-compliant
``` xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <Import Project="../props/simple.props" />
  
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TARGETFRAMEWORK>net8.0</TARGETFRAMEWORK>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <ComPile Include="../common/Code.cs" />
  </ItemGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <packagereference Include="Qowaiv" Version="7.1.3" />
  </ItemGroup>
  
</Project>
```

## Compliant
``` xml
