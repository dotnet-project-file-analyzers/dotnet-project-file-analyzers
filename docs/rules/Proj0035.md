# Proj0035: Remove deprecated RestoreProjectStyle property
Microsoft introduced the `<RestoreProjectStyle>` to smoothen package restoring
using `packages.config`. This way of defining third-party dependencies has been
deprecated for a very long time now. The property should be removed, and if the
`packages.config` still exists its package references should be converted too.

## Non-compliant
``` xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
    <RestoreProjectStyle>PackageReference</RestoreProjectStyle>
  </PropertyGroup>

</Project>
```

## Compliant
``` xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>

</Project>
```
