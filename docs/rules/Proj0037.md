# Proj0037: Exclude runtime when all assets are private
For some `<PackageReference>`s (code generators, analyzers, etc.) the
referenced package does not contain any assembly that should be accessible
runtime. This is indicated by `PrivateAssets="all"`. Without also specifying
`ExcludeAssets="runtime"` however, the IDE might still suggest to access code
shipped with the package which would fail runtime.

## Non-compliant
``` xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="DotNetProjectFile.Analyzers" Version="1.5.10.1" PrivateAssets="all" />
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```

## Compliant
``` xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="DotNetProjectFile.Analyzers" Version="1.5.10.1" PrivateAssets="all" ExcludeAssets="runtime" />
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```
