# Proj0041: NuGet security audits should report on moderate issues at minimum

When [enabled](Proj0004.md), GitHub's vulnerability database is consulted to
check for security issues that come with using any of the referenced packages.
Although we could ignore issues with a low, moderate, or even high severity
level, this rule advises to at least report on moderate issues and up.
