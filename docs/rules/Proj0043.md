# Proj0043: Use lock files
By default, the package versions specified by either the `PackageReference` or `PackageVersion` are used 
[as constraints for which dependency versions are allowed to be used](https://www.endorlabs.com/learn/strengthening-security-in-net-development-with-packages-lock-json)
when building the project. This means that the
[resolved package versions might change over time](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/enable-repeatable-package-restores-using-a-lock-file/#why-use-a-lock-file),
leading to non-reproducible builds or [security issues](https://www.meziantou.net/faster-and-safer-nuget-restore-using-source-mapping-and-lock-files.htm).

In order to prevent these issues, it is advisable to enable .NET's [lock files](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/enable-repeatable-package-restores-using-a-lock-file/)
(similar to [npm's package-lock.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-lock-json))
when building your production code. This requires setting the `RestorePackagesWithLockFile` property to `true`,
**and** ensuring that [locked mode is enabled when building for production](./Proj0044.md).
