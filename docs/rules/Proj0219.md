# Proj0219: Packable projects should be libraries
Creating [NuGet packages](../general/nuget-packages.md) for project files other
than libraries is unusual and often indicates a misconfiguration.

A known exception to this rule are [.NET CLI tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/global-tools-how-to-create)
packages which requires `<PackAsTool>` to be `true`.

This rule reports on any project that is packable and not a library or a .NET CLI tool.

If your project is the exception to this rule, you should disable this rule for
the reported project.

## Non-compliant
