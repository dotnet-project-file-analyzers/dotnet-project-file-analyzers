# Proj0219: Packable projects should be libraries
Creating [NuGet packages](../general/nuget-packages.md) for project files other
than libraries is so rare that we consder it to be a mistake.

If your project is the exception to this rule, you should disable this rule for
the reported project.

## Non-compliant
``` xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net9.0</TargetFramework>
    <OutputType>exe</OutputType>
    <IsPackable>true</IsPackable>
  </PropertyGroup>

</Project>
```

## Compliant
``` xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
 
 <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net9.0</TargetFramework>
    <OutputType>Library</OutputType>
    <IsPackable>true</IsPackable>
  </PropertyGroup>

</Project>
```
