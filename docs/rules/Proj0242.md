# Proj0242: Generate NuGet packages conditionally
To ensure that packages are not interdependently shipped in DEBUG (or other)
mode, a conditional statement should be defined on `<GeneratePackageOnBuild>`
or any of it ancestor nodes. Doing so, NuGet's artifacts are only generated
during a RELEASE (or other intendend) build mode.

## Non-compliant
``` xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <GeneratePackageOnBuild>true</GeneratePackageOnBuild>
  </PropertyGroup>

</Project>
```

## Compliant
``` xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup Condition="'$(Configuration)'=='Release'">
    <GeneratePackageOnBuild>true</GeneratePackageOnBuild>
  </PropertyGroup>

</Project>
```
