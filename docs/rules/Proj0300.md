# Proj0300: Configure NuGet explicitly
The only way to ensure that NuGet is set up safely is by adding a `NuGet.config`
file that is part of the source code. This prevents malicious configuration being
present that is altered out of side in the global configuration.

## Compliant
A `NuGet.config` file accessable to the project:
``` xml
 <configuration>
  <packageSources>
    <clear />
    <add key="NuGet" value="https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json" />
  </packageSources>
</configuration>
```
