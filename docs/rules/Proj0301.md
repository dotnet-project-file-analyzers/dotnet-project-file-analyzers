# Proj0301: Clear previous defined package sources
To prevent [supply chain attacks](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Software_Supply_Chain_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html)
no package sources should be inheritted from globally defined sources that
could contain malicious sources. By adding `<clear />`, all previously defined
sources are removed.

## Non-compliant
``` xml
 <configuration>
  <packageSources>
    <add key="NuGet" value="https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json" />
  </packageSources>
</configuration>
```

## Compliant
``` xml
 <configuration>
  <packageSources>
    <clear />
    <add key="NuGet" value="https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json" />
  </packageSources>
</configuration>
```
