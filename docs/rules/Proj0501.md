# Proj0501: Package only contains a deprecated license URL
Using a [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org) package implies that you
and/or your company explicitly agree with the legally binding conditions of the
license and the copyright of the owner of the package.

In the past, Microsoft decided to communicate the license of a package via a
[`<licenseUrl>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/nuget/reference/nuspec#licenseurl).
This feature has been deprecated since 2018. You are advised to use
either a newer version of the package (with a resolveble license) or to contact
the creator of the package and ask for an update.

This rule can detect used licenses in NuGet spec files, but can not be
considered legal advice, nor is this documentation.
