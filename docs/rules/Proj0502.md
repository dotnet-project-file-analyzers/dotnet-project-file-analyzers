# Proj0502: Only include packages compliant with project license
Using a [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org) package implies that you
and/or your company explicitly agree with the legally binding conditions of the
license and the copyright of the owner of the package.

If a third-party package license is not compliant with the license of the
project, this rule will report the license violation.

## Configure
You can specify a license (expression) as follows:

``` xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <PackageLicenseExpression>MIT</AllowedLicenses>
  </PropertyGroup>
  
</Project>
```

This rule can detect used licenses in NuGet spec files, but can not be
considered legal advice, nor is this documentation.
