# Proj0503: Package license is unknown
Using a [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org) package implies that you
and/or your company explicitly agree with the legally binding conditions of the
license and the copyright of the owner of the package.

If a third-party package license comes with a custom license (other than one
specified by the [SPDX](https://spdx.dev)), this rule ensures that the license
must have been approved.

To approve a license, a `<ThirdPartyLicense>` node has to be added with a
matching include and a hash of the license file. That hash is communicated for
licenses which lack such a registration.

## Non-compliant
``` xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="SonarAnalyzer.CSharp" Version="10.6.0.109712" />
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```

## Compliant
``` xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="SonarAnalyzer.CSharp" Version="10.6.0.109712" />
  </ItemGroup>

  <ItemGroup Label="Approved licenses">
    <ThirdPartyLicense Include="SonarAnalyzer.CSharp" Hash="ZOAgZmx18wSWq5KpOpWd2bB9123" />
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```

This rule can detect used licenses in NuGet spec files, but can not be
considered legal advice, nor is this documentation.
