# Proj0504: Package license has changed
Using a [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org) package implies that you
and/or your company explicitly agree with the legally binding conditions of the
license and the copyright of the owner of the package.

If a third-party package license comes with a custom license (other than one
specified by the [SPDX](https://spdx.dev)), this rule ensures that the license
did not change unnoticed. It does so by communicating that the hash of the
license is different from the license approved one.
