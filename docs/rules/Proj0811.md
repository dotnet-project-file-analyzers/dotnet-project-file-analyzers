# Proj0811: Directory.Build.props and Directory.Packages.props should be in the same dirctory
Both `Directory.Build.props` as `Directory.Packages.props` allow to share MSBuild
configuration over multiple project files. To prevent confusion, when using both
(the latter logically is only used when [Central Package Management](Proj0800.md)
has been enabled), should be put in the same directory.
