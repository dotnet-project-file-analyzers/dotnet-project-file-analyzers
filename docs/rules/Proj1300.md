# Proj1300: Avoid project references to executables
The use of multiple projects in a single solution improve code organization by
separating concerns into distinct layers or components, making maintenance and
testing easier, facilitating team collaboration, and enabling the reuse of code
across different applications.

Executables are considered the leaves of the dependency tree, and should not be
used as dependency to other projects, except for test projects to test these
targets.
