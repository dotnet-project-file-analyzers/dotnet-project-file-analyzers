# Proj1301: Project references of packable targets should be packable
The use of multiple projects in a single solution is to improve code organization by
separating concerns into distinct layers or components, making maintenance and
testing easier, facilitating team collaboration, and enabling the reuse of code
across different applications.

To prevent issues with shipping [packable](../general/nuget-packages.md)
projects, all referenced projects should have `<IsPackable>` enabled too.
