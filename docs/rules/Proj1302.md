# Proj1302: Avoid project references to test projects
The use of multiple projects in a single solution is to improve code organization by
separating concerns into distinct layers or components, making maintenance and
testing easier, facilitating team collaboration, and enabling the reuse of code
across different applications.

Test projects should not have another purpose than just be executed to run the
containing tests, and therefor should not be referenced by other projects.
