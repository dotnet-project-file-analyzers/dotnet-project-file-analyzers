# Proj4050: Header must be a GLOB
An [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) file helps maintain consistent coding
styles for multiple developers working on the same project across various
editors and IDEs.

Key element of `.editorconfig` is that the text of the header is a GLOB that
matches the files the key-value pairs of the section apply to. Therefor,
they must be valid [GLOB](https://spec.editorconfig.org/#glob-expressions)s.
