# Proj5000: Use SLNX solution files
Solution files have been a part of the .NET and Visual Studio experience for
many years now, and theyâ€™ve had the same custom SLN format the whole time.
Starting in .NET SDK 9.0.200, the dotnet CLI supports the use of SLNX format,
a less verbose, easy to read XML format that is resambles the other MSBuild
(project) file structure.

See [Microsoft's blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-slnx-support-dotnet-cli/).
