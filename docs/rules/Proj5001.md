# Proj5001: Remove SLN solution files
Solution files have been a part of the .NET and Visual Studio experience for
many years now, and theyâ€™ve had the same custom SLN format the whole time.
Starting in .NET SDK 9.0.200, the dotnet CLI supports the use of SLNX format,
a less verbose, easy to read XML format that resembles the other MSBuild
(project) file structure.

When using [SLNX solution files](Proj5000.md), there is no need to also keep 
SLN solution files. This rule helps to track those files that still exist on
disk.
