# Proj5005: Omit Project ID's
Projects in the SLN file had a (unique) ID. In the SLNX file, this ID does not
have any added value, and is considered noise.

## Non-Compliant
``` xml
<Solution>
  <Project Path=".net.csproj" />
  <Project Path="src/MyProject/MyProject.csproj" Id="7B3656D1-98AD-45C8-826F-2E5A13BED71E" />
</Solution>
```

## Compliant
``` xml
<Solution>
  <Project Path=".net.csproj" />
  <Project Path="src/MyProject/MyProject.csproj" />
</Solution>
```
