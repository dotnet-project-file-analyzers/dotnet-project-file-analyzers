# Sonarcloud
*Currently, this readme is confirmed to work for SonarCloud. The steps in this guide
might also be relevant for other [SonarSource](https://www.sonarsource.com) products,
such as SonarQube, but this has not been verified at this time*

[Sonarcloud](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarcloud/) is a service which allows
you to scan your code for issues, and gives an online dashboard allowing you to see which
issues exist within the code. This includes any warnings generated by analyzers. In
addition, it has integration with DevOps platforms (such as [GitHub](https://github.com/)
and [Azure](https://dev.azure.com/)), which can be set up to automatically add comments
on pull requests on any new warnings that the change has made, which can help in improving
code quality.

## The issue with this analyzer and Sonarcloud
Sonarcloud's analyzer software can run while a build is being made, for example as part
of a Pull Request check. However, Sonarcloud, by default, does not pick up any warnings
generated by `.??proj` and `.props` files. This means that any warnings generated by this
 analyzer will not generate comments on pull requests, nor with they show up in their
reports, which could result in a situation where they are not noticed and solved by
developers.

## Sonarcloud integration
There is currently no *'elegant'* solution to have the warnings show up on SonarCloud,
however, there is a workaround. By adding the `.??proj` and `.props` files as content,
SonarCloud will recognise it's warnings and pick them up, same as any warnings in the
code.

For Example:
``` xml
  <ItemGroup>
    <Content Include="*.??proj" CopyToOutputDirectory="Never"/>
    <Content Include="../../props/common.props" CopyToOutputDirectory="Never" Link="Properties/common.props"/>
    <Content Include="../../Directory.Packages.props" CopyToOutputDirectory="Never" Link="Properties/Directory.Packages.props"/>
  </ItemGroup>
```
