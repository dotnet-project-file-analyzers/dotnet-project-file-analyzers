# Proj0002: Upgrade legacy MS Build project files
In 2017, Microsoft introduced a new MS Build project file structure for .NET.
The previous format dated back to 2003, when .NET 1.0 was released.

The new (well, not anymore) format is way less verbose, and the old format
does not support .NET core/standard or .NET 5.0+.

Note that all rules of `DotNetProjectFile.Analyzers` do not support the legacy
MS Build project format. So also from that perspective, it is better to update.
