# Proj0006: Add additional files to improve static code analysis
The .NET project file analyzers need access to files that are not available
via the analyzer context. By adding additional non-compiling files, those
files become available in the analyzer context too.

See: [https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/main/docs/analyzers/Using%20Additional%20Files.md](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/main/docs/analyzers/Using%20Additional%20Files.md)

## Compliant
For project files, it is advised to add  the additional file with `Visible="false"`
as seeing it twice in the IDE is adding confusion.
``` xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <ItemGroup>
    <AdditionalFiles Include="*.csproj" Visible="false" />
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```

For properties, it is advised to add the additional file with a link to the
_special_ properties folder, to simplify the access to the files.
``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Project>

  <ItemGroup>
    <AdditionalFiles Include="../props/common.props" Link="Properties/common.props" />
  </ItemGroup>
  
</Project>
```
