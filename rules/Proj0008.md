# Proj0008: Remove folder nodes
`<Folder>` nodes only add noise. They are leftovers of directories created in the
IDE; allowing to show the folder while it does not contain a file relevant for
the .NET project yet. This should only exist temporarily.

## Non-compliant
``` xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <ItemGroup>
    <Folder Include="SomeFolder\" />
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```

## Compliant
``` xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

</Project>
```
