# Proj0021: Build actions should have a single task
`<ItemGroup>` build taks nodes such as `<Compile>`, `<Content>`, `<EmbeddedResource>`,
`<None>`, and `<AdditionalFiles` should only have on task. Assigning multiple
tasks to a single node separated by semicolons (`;`) leads to longer lines
that are harder to read and maintain.

<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <ItemGroup>
    <None Include="../common/LICENSE.md;README.md" />
  </ItemGroup>
