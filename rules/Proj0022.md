# Proj0022: Build action includes should exist
`<ItemGroup>` build takes nodes such as `<Compile>`, `<Content>`, `<EmbeddedResource>`,
`<None>`, and `<AdditionalFiles` can define an `Include`. This include should 
refer to one or multiple files.

## Non-compliant

``` XML
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <ItemGroup>
    <None Include="README.md" />
  </ItemGroup>
  
</Project>
```

## Compliant
When `README.md` does exist.
``` XML

    <None Include="README.md" />
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
