# Proj0029: Use C# specific properties only when applicable
When building a C# project, MS Build supports multiple C# only
properties to be set. For none C# projects however, setting these
properties does not make any sense.

## C# only properties
- AllowUnsafeBlocks
- CheckForOverflowUnderflow
- Nullable
