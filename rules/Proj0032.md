# Proj0032: Migrate away from BinaryFormatter
Starting with .NET 9, Microsoft no longer includes an implementation of
`BinaryFormatter` in the runtime (it has [been deprecated](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/compatibility/serialization/5.0/binaryformatter-serialization-obsolete)
with the release of .NET 5). The APIs are still present, but their
implementation always throws an exception, regardless of project type.

Setting the existing backwards compatibility flag is no longer sufficient
to use `BinaryFormatter` with .NET 9, as is explained in [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/binaryformatter-removed-from-dotnet-9/).

Due to the fact that Microsoft discourages the usage as strongly as they
can, this rule reports violations for all target frameworks, and
also when used in combination with [System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/serialization/binaryformatter-migration-guide/compatibility-package).

## Non-compliant
``` XML
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net9.0</TargetFramework>
    <EnableUnsafeBinaryFormatterSerialization>true</EnableUnsafeBinaryFormatterSerialization>
  </PropertyGroup>
  
</Project>
```

## Compliant
``` XML
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net9.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>
  
</Project>
```
