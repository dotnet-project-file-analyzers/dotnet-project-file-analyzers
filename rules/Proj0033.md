# Proj0033: Track uses of ""TODO"" tags
Developers often use TODO tags to mark areas in the code where additional work
or improvements are needed but are not implemented immediately. However, these
TODO tags sometimes get overlooked or forgotten, leading to incomplete or
unfinished code.

This rule aims to identify and address unattended TODO tags in MS BUILD files
to ensure a clean and maintainable codebase. This description explores why this
is a problem and how it can be fixed to improve the overall code quality.
