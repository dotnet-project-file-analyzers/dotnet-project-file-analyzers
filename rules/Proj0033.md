`<ItemGroup>` can have node `<ProjectReference>` which defines an `Include`.
This include should refer to exactly one file.

When `../Benchmarks/Benchmarks.csproj` does not exist.
``` xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <ItemGroup>
    <ProjectReference Include="../Benchmarks/Benchmarks.csproj" />
  </ItemGroup>
  
</Project>
```
