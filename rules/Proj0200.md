# Proj0200: Define the project packability explicitly
To prevent confusion, explicitly define the `<IsPackable>` node. Setting the 
`IsPackable` to `true` indicates that the package should be packed when the
`dotnet pack` [command is executed]((https://learn.microsoft.com/nuget/create-packages/creating-a-package-msbuild)).
This results in the creation of a [NuGet package](../general/nuget-packages.md).

Projects that have `IsPackable` set to `false` will not be packed when the
`dotnet pack` command is executed. This is particularly useful as it prevents the
unintended creation of NuGet packages for projects that were not intended as
such (test projects, etc.).

## Non-compliant
``` XML
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>

</Project>
```

## Compliant
``` XML
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
    <IsPackable>true</IsPackable>
  </PropertyGroup>

</Project>
```
