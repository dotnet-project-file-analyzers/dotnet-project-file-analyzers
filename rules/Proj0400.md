# Proj0400: Define the project publishability explicitly
To prevent confusion, explicitly define the
`<IsPublishable>` node. Setting the `IsPublishable`
to `true` indicates that the package should
be published when the `dotnet publish` command
is executed
([more info](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-publish)).
Projects that have `IsPublishable` set to `false`
will not be published when the `dotnet publish`
command is executed. Note that dependencies of
publishable projects will be included in the
results of `dotnet publish` when executed for
the publishable projects, even if they have
`IsPublishable` set to `false`.

## Non-compliant
``` XML
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>

</Project>
```

## Compliant
``` XML
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
    <IsPublishable>true</IsPublishable>
  </PropertyGroup>

</Project>
```
