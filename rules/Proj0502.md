# Proj0502: Only include packages with a compliant license
Using a [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org) package implies that you
and/or your company explicitly agree with the legally binding conditions of the
license and the copyright of the owner of the package.

By default, MIT and Apache-2.0 are allowed.

This rule can detect used licenses in NuGet spec files, but can not be
considered legal advice, nor is this documentation.

## Configure
You can specify which license (expressions) are allowed, using `<AllowedLicenses>`.

``` xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <AllowedLicenses>MIT,MPL-1.1,Apache-2.0</AllowedLicenses>
  </PropertyGroup>
  
</Project>
```

For packages that do not come with a generic license (expression) such as MIT,
it is possible to specify that these packages are allowed, using the 
`<AllowedThirdPartyPackages>`. Wildcard characters are allowed.

``` xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <AllowedThirdPartyPackages>
      SonarAnalyzer.Csharp,
      MyCompany.*
    </AllowedThirdPartyPackages>
  </PropertyGroup>

</Project>
```
