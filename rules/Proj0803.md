# Proj0803: Use VersionOverride only with Central Package Management enabled
When [Central Package Management](Proj0800.md) is not enabled, the use of the
`VersionOverride` property on a `<PackageReference>` has no effect. It is most
likely an mistake; or `Version` was intended, or the CPM has been unintentionally
disabled.

## Non-compliant
``` xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Qowaiv" VersionOverride="7.0.4" />
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```

## Compliant
``` xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Qowaiv" VersionOverride="7.0.4" />
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```

Or enabled CPM.
