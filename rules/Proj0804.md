# Proj0804: Use Version only with Central Package Management not enabled
When [Central Package Management](Proj0800.md) is enabled, the use of the
`Version` property on a `<PackageReference>` has no effect. It is most
likely an mistake; or `VersionOverride` was intended, or the CPM has been
unintentionally disabled.

## Non-compliant
``` xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Qowaiv" Version="7.0.4" />
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```

## Compliant
``` xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Qowaiv" VersionOverride="7.0.4" />
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```

or

``` xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Qowaiv" />
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```

or disable CPM.
