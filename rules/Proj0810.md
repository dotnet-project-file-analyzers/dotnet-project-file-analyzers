# Proj0810: Remove unused package versions
When using [Central Package Management](Proj0800.md) the central
`Directory.Packages.props` contains `<PackageVersion>`s for all
`<PackageRefence>`s in the solution. To reduce noise, this rule reports on
`<PackageVersion`s that are (no longer) referenced. This rule requires a
[`.net.csproj` SDK project](../general/sdk.md) to work.
