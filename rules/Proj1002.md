# Proj1002: Use Microsoft's analyzers
[Microsoft](https://microsoft.com) has implemented multiple generic
Roslyn static code analysis rules both for C# and Visual Basic. These rules
allow you to produce safe, reliable and maintainable code by helping you find
and correct bugs, vulnerabilities and code smells in your codebase. It is
strongly advised to enable these rules on all your projects.

For .NET 5 and later, <EnableNETAnalyzers> is enabled by default. However,
it is considered a good practice to explicitly enable it for later frameworks
as well.

See: [learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/overview)
