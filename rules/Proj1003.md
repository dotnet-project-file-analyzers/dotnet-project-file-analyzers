# Proj1003: Use Sonar analyzers
[SonarSource](https://www.sonarsource.com/) has implemented multiple generic
Roslyn static code analysis rules both for C# and Visual Basic. These rules
allow you to produce safe, reliable and maintainable code by helping you find
and correct bugs, vulnerabilities and code smells in your codebase. It is
strongly advised to enable these rules on all your projects.

See: [https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-dotnet](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-dotnet)

## Compliant
For C# projects:
``` xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <ItemGroup Label="Analyzers">
    <PackageReference Include="SonarAnalyzer.CSharp" Version="*" PrivateAssets="all" IncludeAssets="runtime; build; native; contentfiles; analyzers; buildtransitive" />
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```

For VB.NET projects:
``` xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <ItemGroup Label="Analyzers">
    <PackageReference Include="SonarAnalyzer.VisualBasic" Version="* PrivateAssets="all" IncludeAssets="runtime; build; native; contentfiles; analyzers; buildtransitive" />
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
