# Proj1100: Avoid using Moq
Since [Moq v4.20](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Moq/4.20) a dependency to 
[SponsorLink](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Devlooped.SponsorLink/1.0.0) has
been added. This is a project that tries to retrieve data (email addresses)
from your system and sends them to an external system. This violates
[GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) and
the good practices of [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source).

Therefore, usage is strongly discouraged.
