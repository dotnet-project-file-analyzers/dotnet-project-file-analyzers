# Proj4051: Use equals sign for key-value assignments
An [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) file helps maintain consistent
coding styles for multiple developers working on the same project across
various editors and IDEs.

The specification states that `=` should be used as assignment character, not
`:`. Multiple IDEs (including Visual Studio), however, do support the `:`.

## Non-compliant
``` ini
[*]
end_of_line: crlf
```

## Compliant
``` ini
[*]
end_of_line = crlf
```
